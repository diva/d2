*** Release Notes ***

This is diva-r20232 corresponding to OpenSim 0.7.4. With respect to
the previous 4 releases, this is a minor release, but with nice
improvements. It does not need any special reconfiguration. However,
with respect to releases prior to r15402, this is a major release and
requires further action.  See release notes below for older releases.

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.4_Release
Many new features and improvements!, most notably:

- Teleport reliability improved

- Added ability to establish friendships over the Hypergrid without
requiring both users to originate from the same OpenSimulator
installation.

- osGetGridGatekeeperURI() OSSL function added to return the Hypergrid
gatekeeper of the current grid (if there is one). This is the first
component of any Hypergrid address, for example the hg.osgrid.org:80
part of hg.osgrid.org:80:<region-name> 

- llRequestSimulatorData() will now return the final destination
region co-ordinates when used for a Hypergrid location. This allows
one to check that the final destination region is not more than the
allowed number of map tiles away for a successful teleport (currently
4095 map tiles or less). 

** Changes in D2 configurations

- Freshly created worlds are now flat by default

** Changes in Wifi

None


===================== Older release notes ====================

==== r18611 ====

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.3.1_Release
Many new features and improvements!, most notably:

- simple_build_permissions option added which allows owners and those
  on the access list of a parcel to build even when the general parcel 
  setting is to disallow object creation. 
- More region access controls added at the simulator level. 
  DisallowForeigners prevents Hypergrid visitors from visiting 
  regions. DisallowResidents allows only administrators and managers
  to visit regions. 
- DataSnapshot now sending the correct information about the Gatekeeper
  to the search service

** Changes in D2 configurations

- simple_build_permissions is enabled by default, meaning that you can
  protect your land from general building while allowing some people
  to build (add them to access list)
- Default terrain is now a flat land

** Changes in Wifi

None

==== r18222 ====

This is diva-r18222 corresponding to OpenSim 0.7.3-post-fixes. With
respect to the previous 2 releases (r16897 and r15592), this is a
major release but does not need any special attention. However, with
respect to releases prior to r15402, this is a major release and
requires further action.  See release notes below for older releases.

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.3_Release
Many new features and improvements!, most notably:

- You can now run OpenSim in 64 bit Windows machines without having to 
  launch it through OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe.  This allows OpenSimulator 
  to address more than 2GB of memory of memory.
- Fixed a long-standing issue where scripted attachments were corrupted 
  for HG travellers
- Object sit targets have been adjusted to much better match those found 
  on the Linden grid. This is for long term compatibility purposes. 
  Unfortunately, it means that existing objects will need to have their 
  sit targets manually adjusted. The adjustment is <-0.1, 0, 0.118>.
- Many performance improvements
- Linksets now retaining their proper numbering when one set is linked 
  with another.
- More improvements on NPC

** Changes in D2 configurations

- NPC functions enabled by default. Permission set to ESTATE_OWNER, but
  if you want to be more relaxed, this can be overriden in MyWorld.ini.

** Changes in Wifi

None
==== r16897 ====

This is diva-r16897 corresponding to OpenSim 0.7.2-post-fixes. With
respect to the previous 2 releases (r15592 and r15402), this is a
major release but does not need any special attention. However, with
respect to releases prior to r15402, this is a major release and
requires further action.  See release notes below for older releases.

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.2_Release
Many new features and improvements!, most notably:

- You can now make friends across the hypergrid and IM them
- You can lure your HG friends into where you are
- You can give inventory to your HG friends by dragging inventory
  into their profile
- You can grab HG landmarks and later teleport to those places

** Changes in Wifi

- Added missing localization dlls (does not affect anyone with English
  language)

- Support for SQLite (not included in diva distribution)

- (This is not a new change, and it doesn't affect anyone that uses
  the Diva distro out of the box, but it may affect those who further
  customize it): If you are reusing an older configuration for Wifi,
  you may not be getting the most out of it. The latest Wifi releases
  use Diva.Data.MySql.dll as storage plugin, not
  OpenSim.Data.MySql.dll. On of the symptoms that you are using the
  "wrong" dll is the front page of Wifi showing 0 for all the
  stats. If that's the case, switch it to the Diva one under
  [DatabaseService]


==== r15592 ====

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7.1.1_Release

Most noteworthy, gray tiles in the map have been fixed.

** Noteworthy configuration changes that affect your D2 installation

Configure.exe ON YOUR NEW INSTALLATION. Answer the questions with the
exact same data that you have on your current
config-include/MyWorld.ini. If you had made additional changes to your
MyWorld.ini, make sure to port those after running Configure.exe

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A RELEASE PRIOR TO r13458, PLEASE READ THE

==== r13458 ====

PLEASE READ THESE NOTES CAREFULLY, especially if you are upgrading
from an older release.

This diva distro is based on the official 0.7 release, more
specifically on the 0.7-post-fixes branch. 
The exact GIT tag is shown on the name of the zip file.

This is a major release, with major changes across the board.

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release

** Changes in configuration variables

The changes are inumerous. IF YOU GOT THIS RELEASE THROUGH AN UPDATE,
YOU MUST RUN CONFIGURE AGAIN, so that the new configurations are put
in place. 

** Changes in Networking assumptions

This new release features HG 1.5, an improved version of the Hypergrid
architecture that includes a fair amount of security. 
(see http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release#Hypergrid_changes)

This added security imposes a few more constraints on how to set up
your network *properly*. THESE CHANGES AFFECT PRIMARILY HOME NETWORKS,
whose routers often have NAT issues.

Due to these changes, it is advised that people provide domain names
instead of IP addresses in the configurations. In home networks, the
use of an IP address as the external host name of the world may
prevent you from either logging in or hypergriding out (this depends
heavily on your router).

For more information and useful advice, see doc/DNS.txt

** New diva distro addon: Wifi

This new release features an embedded Web application called
Wifi. Wifi handles user registrations to your world.

For more information, see doc/WIFI.txt

** What to expect on first run

If you are upgrading from an older release, your first run of this
release will exhibit unusual behaviors. All subsequent runs will be
normal. Here are some of the things that you should expect from the
first run:

- Startup will take more time. This is due to DB changes. The more
  assets your world has, the longer this takes. Don't interrupt that
  process.
- You will be asked a few questions from OpenSim itself. See 
  doc/OSQUESTIONS.txt
- On first login, avatar appearances will be gone. You need to wear
  them again.
- Home information will be gone. You need to set your home location
  again. 

** Troubleshooting

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release#Troubleshooting

==== r11766 ====

** Additions 

- There is a new addon module, LibraryModule, that allows sim 
  operators to add arbitrary new content in the OpenSim Library,
  so that it can be used by all users of the local world.
  The library content should be placed as .iar files under bin/Library.
  When the .iar file name partially matches the name of one of the
  existing library subfolders, the content is placed under those;
  top otherwise.

- There are two small .iar files included in the distribution,
  one with outfits and the other with a few objects. Operators can
  add more .iar files to bin/Library; they all add up.

** Changes in configuration preferences

- LibraryModule = true, to enable the library module. 

** Bug fixes in distribution

- the previous release didn't have the image module by mistake

- landing on prims works again
- several performance improvements and increased stability
