No changes

--------------------------------------

diva-wifi-0-7-2

*** Changes since previous release:

- Added missing localization dlls (does not affect anyone with English
  language)

- Support for SQLite

- (This is not a new change, and it doesn't affect anyone that uses
  the Diva distro out of the box, but it may affect those who further
  customize it): If you are reusing an older configuration for Wifi,
  you may not be getting the most out of it. The latest Wifi releases
  use Diva.Data.MySql.dll as storage plugin, not
  OpenSim.Data.MySql.dll. On of the symptoms that you are using the
  "wrong" dll is the front page of Wifi showing 0 for all the
  stats. If that's the case, switch it to the Diva one under
  [DatabaseService]

Thank you Marck for major contributions to Wifi!

*** Changes since previous release:

  (Male, Female, Neutral) but as many as you want. See Wifi

  sheet replacing the original style.css. Fluid adapts to the size of

*** Configuration changes:

NOTE: This change affects primarily users running Wifi on a
grid. Users of diva distro installations will have this updated
automatically via DivaPreferences.ini, and should not worry.

The way default avatar types is specified has changed. There used to
be exactly 3 types, specified as
  FemaleAvatarAccount = "Female Avatar"
  MaleAvatarAccount = "Male Avatar"
  NeutralAvatarAccount = "Neutral Avatar"

The syntax has now changed to
  AvatarAccount_Neutral = "Neutral Avatar"
  AvatarAccount_Female = "Female Avatar"
  AvatarAccount_Male = "Male Avatar"

Make sure to update your configuration.

This new syntax enables the existence of an arbitrary number of avatar
types, like this:
  AvatarAccount_<AvatarType> = "<FirstName> <LastName>"

*** Bug fixes since previous release:

- Catch bad To address on sendmail
- Require new accounts to have non-empty first and last names
- Don't send the password by email
- Removed empty rows at the end of lists on composed web pages
- Stay on current page when links "Activate" or "Ignore" are selected
  in empty pending accounts list
- List only non-pending accounts in user search results
- Correct confirmation text for deleting user account
- Fix spelling error in password recovery web page
