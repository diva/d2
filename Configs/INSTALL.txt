*** Diva Distribution of OpenSim ***

The Diva distribution is a binary distribution. As such, it is very
simple to install. If you come across web pages with instructions for
installing OpenSim, please keep this in mind -- this distribution does
not need anything related to getting and compiling source code
(e.g. git, nant, etc).

Follow these 5 (6 in *ix) steps for installation of this OpenSim distribution.

     doc/MONO.txt
     for important instructions on how to setup mono for
     OpenSim]
