Welcome to D2!

== OVERVIEW ==

D2 is a BSD Licensed Open Source project whose purpose is to provide a simple-to-use binary distribution of OpenSim, along with a few addon-ons and tools that make it easy to manage and maintain your virtual world.

This project contains the code for some of the tools, along with the code for creating a packaged zip file out of an extended opensim tree. It does not contain the extended opensim tree itself. That is hosted in another project called diva-distribution.

== More Information on OpenSim ==

More extensive information on building, running, and configuring
OpenSim, as well as how to report bugs, and participate in the OpenSim
project can always be found at http://opensimulator.org.

Thanks for trying D2, we hope it is a pleasant experience.
